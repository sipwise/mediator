      "message": "Yes, reason being: above deals with data from MySQL primarily, which does the sorting in the query. So it only needs to re-sort if data from Redis is merged. This one here is using Redis primarily, which always needs to be sorted. Previously the code was using g_list_insert_sorted during the fetch routine, which was converted to a g_list_prepend plus the sorting here.",
